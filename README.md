# 🚕 Ola-Ride-Insights

## 📌 Overview
Ola-Ride-Insights is a data analytics project that explores ride-hailing data to identify meaningful trends, patterns, and business insights. The project focuses on understanding ride demand, pricing behavior, trip distribution, and customer usage to support operational and strategic decision-making.

This project simulates real-world analytics used by mobility and transportation platforms.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze ride demand across different time periods
- Identify peak hours and high-demand locations
- Understand fare distribution and revenue trends
- Study ride frequency and trip duration patterns
- Provide visual insights for business optimization

---

## 🧠 Key Insights Generated
- Peak ride demand hours and days
- High-revenue and high-traffic zones
- Average trip duration and distance analysis
- Fare trends based on time and location
- Ride volume comparison across regions

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries & Tools:**
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Jupyter Notebook (for analysis and visualization)

## 📊 Data Analysis Workflow
1. **Data Collection**
   - Imported structured ride data (CSV format)

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed null values
   - Handled duplicates
   - Converted timestamps and numeric fields

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Time-based ride demand analysis
   - Fare and distance distribution
   - Location-based ride comparison

4. **Visualization**
   - Line charts for demand trends
   - Bar charts for location-wise rides
   - Histograms for fare and duration analysis
